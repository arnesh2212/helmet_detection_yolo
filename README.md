Title: Helmet Detection for Motorcycle Safety

Description:

This project aims to enhance road safety by developing an object detection model specifically designed to identify the number of people on a single motorcycle wearing helmets. The model is trained using the largest annotated motorcycle helmet use dataset, which comprises 910 video clips recorded at 12 observation sites in Myanmar in 2016.

Key Features:
Object Detection:
The core functionality of the model is its ability to detect and count the number of individuals on a motorcycle, while specifically identifying whether each person is wearing a helmet or not.

Dataset Details:
The model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset consisting of 910 video clips, providing diverse scenarios and perspectives of motorcycle traffic. This dataset was meticulously annotated, ensuring the model's ability to generalize well across various real-world conditions.

Focus on Motorcycle Safety:
With a specific focus on motorcycle safety, the model addresses a critical aspect of road safetyâ€”ensuring that individuals on motorcycles are wearing helmets. This is crucial for minimizing the risk of head injuries and promoting responsible riding habits.

Inference:
Utilize the trained model for inference on your own images or videos by following the examples provided in the prediction file. Adjust the paths and parameters as needed.
